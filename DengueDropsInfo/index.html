		</div>
	</header>
	<p id="first">
		DengueDrops is a web-based calculator for the calculation of the required fluid amounts and IV flow rates for non-shock (group-B) dengue patients. Biomedical Engineers from BUET and a team of physicians have developed this tool. The app takes inputs about the patient (age, height, gender, weight, BP, capillary refill time) and calculates the required IV fluid in drops per minute for patients of every age group based on the cannula type used (adult/pediatric). It provides maintenance and deficit fluid levels and suggests total amounts of fluid that should be administered intravenously and orally. 
		<br><br>
		The recent dengue outbreak in Bangladesh has been a grave concern for public health officials. As of 20 November 2022, 52,807 laboratory-confirmed dengue cases and 230 related deaths have been reported by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare of Bangladesh since 1 January 2022, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.44%. Dengue has been endemic in the country since 2000, primarily due to the widespread establishment of the Aedes aegypti vector. However, apparently due to the regional rainfall patterns and higher environmental temperatures, the incidence of dengue has grown considerably since 2010. 
		<br><br>
		With no specific treatment available, adequate fluid management is essential to prevent severe outcomes for hospitalized dengue patients. The national guidelines provide methods for IV fluid administration based on individual patient's age, weight, and gender. However, as the calculation is complex and time-consuming, healthcare professionals face challenges in correctly administering the patient's IV fluid during peak dengue seasons when hospitals may become overwhelmed. In addition, an initial review of dengue death records in 2022 shows that for about 39% of patients, the IV fluid management guideline was not properly followed. To address this issue, DengueDrops has been conceptualized and developed. 
		<br><br>
		The "DengueDrops" strictly adheres to national guidelines, making it an effective clinical decision support system for healthcare professionals during future dengue outbreaks. We hope that the nationwide scale-up of this digital health tool can significantly improve the overall dengue treatment and recovery in Bangladesh.

	<p id="first">
	With the successful completion of clinical trial phase I , the phase II trial was conducted at the Dhaka Medical College (DMC) on non-Covid hypoxemic patient (SpO2 between 85- 93% in room air) to study the feasibility of the OxyJet CPAP system in the clinical settings. CPAP therapy was provided patients for 1 hour. </p>

	<p id="first">After the trial we have found significant increase (11.2%) in the blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) of patients, while other physiological parameters remained relatively unchanged. </p>

	<h2> Clinical Trial - Phase - III (Hypoxemic Patients):</h2> 
	<br>
	<hr>
	<p id="first">
	After the successful completion of clinical trial phase I and phase II , BMRC provided approval for the clinical trial phase III. This phase is a randomized controlled trial, designed to compare between HFNC and OxyJet CPAP on a total of 40 patients admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH). Patients with %SpO2 between 85 â€“ 90% are enrolled who have failed to respond to 15L/m of oxygen. Our phase III clinical trial is ongoing at DMCH under the supervision of clinical co-investigators at DMCH. Interim data shows that both treatment arms have similar clinical outcomes, while OxyJet CPAP consumes 30% less oxygen compared to HFNC.
